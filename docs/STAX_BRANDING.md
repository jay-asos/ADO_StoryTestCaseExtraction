## STAX (Story & Test Automation eXtractor)

STAX is an AI-assisted platform for extracting, generating, synchronizing, and monitoring user stories and test cases from higher-level work items (Epics, Features, etc.).

### Previous Name
Originally known as "ADO Story Extractor" / "ADO Story Test Case Extraction". Renamed to reflect broader, multi-platform direction (ADO today, extensible to Jira and others).

### Acronym Meaning
S – Story  
T – Test  
A – Automation  
X – eXtractor (and eXtensibility)

### Tagline Options
- "From Epics to Executables"  
- "Automated Story & Test Intelligence"  
- "AI-Powered Backlog Acceleration"  

### Elevator Pitch
STAX ingests Epics or large requirements, derives properly structured user stories and rich test cases, detects changes over time, and syncs updates automatically—reducing manual backlog grooming and accelerating delivery readiness.

### Core Pillars
1. Extraction – AI-driven story & test generation
2. Synchronization – Keeps ADO (and future platforms) current
3. Monitoring – Change detection with hashing & snapshots
4. Governance – Duplicate prevention & configurable workflows

### Naming Conventions
- Docker image: `stax-app`
- Container name: `stax-app`
- Network: `stax-network`
- Service (future microservices): `stax-<component>`

### Planned Extensions
- Multi-platform (Jira, GitHub Issues)
- Embedding-based semantic change detection
- Test case coverage metrics

### License & Attribution
If referencing the old name in docs, annotate: "Now STAX (formerly ADO Story Extractor)" during transition period.
